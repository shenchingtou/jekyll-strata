# Jekyll starter for the Strata Theme

Credits: Theme from [HTML5Up Strata](https://html5up.net/strata)

## Installation

Fork and install this starter, assuming you are familiar with `Jekyll`. If not, you can read up about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) hosting on Github Pages.

Go to your folder:

Type: `Jekyll serve`


## Notes
This is a barebones port. There is no `_posts` or `_pages` folder set up yet.
I have added additional social media favicons that you can swap in and out.
